# Sample attenuation reports

This directory contains example placeholder reports for common XR devices.

How to generate:

```sh
# from repo root
python openems/generate_sample_reports.py
```

Files created for each device and band:
- `<device>_<freqMHz>_results.json` — JSON report (mode=placeholder, sweep array, timestamps)
- `<device>_<freqMHz>_results.csv` — CSV sweep (freq_mhz, attenuation_db)
- `samples_summary.csv` — index of generated samples

Note: PNG plots are generated by `simulate_box.py` when `matplotlib` is available; the sample generator will attempt to create them if the plotting library is installed on your runner.
